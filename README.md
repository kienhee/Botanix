## What is Botanix Labs?
Botanix Labs wants to build infrastructure to transform Bitcoin from the best money ever made to the programmable layer that will serve as the basis for the future of finance. Our approach is to build the first fully decentralized EVM-equivalent Layer 2 on Bitcoin, where the ease and versatility of EVM meets the decentralization and security of Bitcoin.
Leveraging Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) as a Layer 1 for base settlement and decentralization, Botanix will use a Proof-of-Stake consensus model, where the stakes (represented by bitcoin) are securely stored on the Spiderchain, a distributed network of decentralized multisigs safeguarded by a randomized subset of participants. You will be able to stake your bitcoin on Bitcoin.
